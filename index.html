        <p>Hello! I’m a practical, communicative, and versatile person — someone who loves to learn, share, and engage with creative ideas that have real purpose.</p>
        <p>I have over five years of experience in technical support and customer service, working in fast-paced, high-demand environments. Back in Brazil, I worked as an IT Support Analyst, solving problems efficiently and empathetically while communicating in three languages (Portuguese, Spanish, and English) and helping to improve the user experience across various teams.</p>
        <p>In recent years, a lot has changed: I went through a health challenge (now fully behind me) and made a major life move from Brazil to the UK — both of which brought new perspectives and plenty of growth. During this transition, I focused on developing my skills: I completed a technical course in networking and support, a Google Ads immersion program, earned my degree in Information Technology, and I’m currently studying software development and digital project management.</p>
        <p>I also live with ADHD, which brings its own set of challenges — but also drives me to be creative, resourceful, and always find new ways to stay focused and adaptable. Along the way, I’ve learned to respect my own pace, recognize my limits, and most importantly, never stop growing.</p>
        <p>This space is a living journal of that journey. Here, I’ll share reflections, experiences, technical and personal learnings — all with the goal of connecting, exchanging ideas, and giving an honest look into how I think, how I solve problems, and how I keep evolving.</p>
        <p><strong>Welcome!</strong> Feel free to drop by anytime, follow along, or share your thoughts.</p>
